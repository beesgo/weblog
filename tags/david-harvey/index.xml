      <title>David Harvey - The Rate and Mass of Growth</title>
      <link>/post/david-harvey-the-rate-and-mass-of-growth/</link>

      <guid>/post/david-harvey-the-rate-and-mass-of-growth/</guid>
      <description>In this lecture, David Harvey offers a close reading of Volume III of Karl Marxâ€™s Capital to distinguish the rate of growth versus the mass of growth. Most economists, policy makers, politicians, and the financial press are very concerned about the rate of growth. The rate of growth is in turn critical to the formulation of policy. Yet the mass of growth is actually more significant, and deserves careful analysis. This lecture will devote special attention to the mass of growth.</description>
