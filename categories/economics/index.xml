      <description>Dr. Jack Rasmus discusses the last three chapters of his new book, “The Scourge of Neoliberalism: From Reagan to Trump” with a focus on the growing contradictions within the Neoliberal policy regime in the 21st Century; the deep technological and material forces undermining and driving the contradictions; and why the 2020s decade will require yet another, fourth restructuring of US capitalism that may fundamentally differ from the Neoliberal experience of the past four decades.</description>

      <description>Dr. Jack Rasmus discusses his newest book, &amp;ldquo;The Scourge of Neoliberalism: US Economic Policy from Reagan to Trump&amp;rdquo;, with an emphasis on the practice of neoliberalism as opposed to the economic ideology which obscures its class basis; neoliberalism as the third major capitalist restructuring of the 20th century as a response to the crisis of capitalism in the 1970s; the four economic policy areas, i.e., fiscal, monetary, industrial and external, that require restructuring as capitalism evolves into a new crisis; the fallacies of neoliberalism; government policy encourages offshoring of US manufacturing; global dollar recycling into US treasuries to support the twin US deficits solution; financialization of the economy; shadow banking; deregulation and privatization; neoliberalism socially destructive.</description>

      <description>In-depth analysis of UBI shows its advantages over most welfare, safety net systems. An even better alternative would avoid capitalism&amp;rsquo;s unnecessary production of unemployment because it utilizes technical progress (rising productivity) for profits. The alternative benefits workers&amp;rsquo; leisure rather than profits. It is more democratic and avoids splitting people into unemployed vs employed, non-poor vs poor. population.

      <title>David Harvey - The Rate and Mass of Growth</title>
      <link>https://beesgo.github.io/weblog/post/david-harvey-the-rate-and-mass-of-growth/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:02:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://beesgo.github.io/weblog/post/david-harvey-the-rate-and-mass-of-growth/</guid>
      <description>In this lecture, David Harvey offers a close reading of Volume III of Karl Marx’s Capital to distinguish the rate of growth versus the mass of growth. Most economists, policy makers, politicians, and the financial press are very concerned about the rate of growth. The rate of growth is in turn critical to the formulation of policy. Yet the mass of growth is actually more significant, and deserves careful analysis. This lecture will devote special attention to the mass of growth.</description>

      <title>Trade Unions &#39;Rich and Cowardly&#39; - FRFI! Newspaper</title>
      <link>https://beesgo.github.io/weblog/news/trade-unions-rich-and-cowardly/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 13:56:57 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Created: Thursday, 31 October 2019 - Written by Robert Clough&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering his keynote speech to the 2019 TUC Congress in September, supposed left-wing trade union leader and TUC President Mark Serwotka plaintively asked of the future ‘Will we end up just observing the rise of the far right, including our current government? Will we watch, horrified, the further decimation of our public services? Will we look fearfully at the rise of racism and hate? Will we be passive witnesses of the growth of a climate emergency?’ All the evidence for the past ten years points to one answer – yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British trade union movement stood by as wages were slashed following the 2008 financial crisis, it has remained passive in the face of an onslaught on working conditions, and has pointedly protected Labour councils as they took an axe to jobs and services at the behest of the Tory austerity programme. When Serwotka concluded ‘How can we step up to face the scale of these challenges? For Congress, I hope you agree – stand up to them we must!’, it was no more than braggadocio. British trade unions are not fighting organisations of the working class, and nor are they intended to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
