      <description>2018 marks the 10th anniversary of the stock market crash of 2008; the current financial malaise is the result of the bank bailouts, not the crash; an over-indebted economy cannot be saved unless the banks fail; debt deflation; the magic of compound interest; how pension funds, state and local governments adversely affected by the bank bailouts; growth of the financial extraction FIRE sector (finance, insurance and real estate); quantitative easing; asset price inflation; wealth concentrated at the top in Roman antiquity led to the Dark Age; Eurozone imposition of austerity Greek style; tariffs, economic sanctions and isolationism.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Created: Thursday, 31 October 2019 - Written by Robert Clough&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering his keynote speech to the 2019 TUC Congress in September, supposed left-wing trade union leader and TUC President Mark Serwotka plaintively asked of the future ‘Will we end up just observing the rise of the far right, including our current government? Will we watch, horrified, the further decimation of our public services? Will we look fearfully at the rise of racism and hate? Will we be passive witnesses of the growth of a climate emergency?’ All the evidence for the past ten years points to one answer – yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British trade union movement stood by as wages were slashed following the 2008 financial crisis, it has remained passive in the face of an onslaught on working conditions, and has pointedly protected Labour councils as they took an axe to jobs and services at the behest of the Tory austerity programme. When Serwotka concluded ‘How can we step up to face the scale of these challenges? For Congress, I hope you agree – stand up to them we must!’, it was no more than braggadocio. British trade unions are not fighting organisations of the working class, and nor are they intended to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
