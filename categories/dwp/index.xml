      <description>&lt;p&gt;A UN poverty expert has said Scotland is on “a very different trajectory” to the rest of the UK when it comes to social security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philip Alston, UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said the “spirit” of the welfare state is “alive and humming” north of the border, but is “waning” elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international human rights law professor visited the UK last year to produce a report which found policies of austerity introduced in 2010 were continuing to have “tragic social consequences”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also claimed the Scottish government’s attempts to reduce the impact of social security changes – such as the two-child benefit cap – were not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at an event at the University of Edinburgh, he said: “Scotland is spending a lot of money on mitigation, mitigating measures that they see as the least humane policies that come from London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All of this indicates that Scotland is – at least for now – on a very different trajectory than England when it comes to the social protection of its population.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;New data reveals the relentless attack on disabled benefit claimants in the last decade. The study found that more than 900,000 Job Seeker’s Allowance (JSA) claimants, who reported a disability, have been financially sanctioned since May 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also sanctioned were 110,000 claimants of Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), a benefit paid to someone who is sick, and placed in the “work related activity group” (WRAG). A further 140,000 sanctions were applied, but later cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sanction is applied to someone’s benefit when a claimant is deemed not to have met part of the stated “conditionality” for claiming that benefit. This can include missing an appointment, or not applying for enough jobs in a given time scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
