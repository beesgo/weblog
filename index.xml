      <description>Dr. Jack Rasmus discusses the last three chapters of his new book, “The Scourge of Neoliberalism: From Reagan to Trump” with a focus on the growing contradictions within the Neoliberal policy regime in the 21st Century; the deep technological and material forces undermining and driving the contradictions; and why the 2020s decade will require yet another, fourth restructuring of US capitalism that may fundamentally differ from the Neoliberal experience of the past four decades.</description>

      <description>Dr. Jack Rasmus discusses his newest book, &amp;ldquo;The Scourge of Neoliberalism: US Economic Policy from Reagan to Trump&amp;rdquo;, with an emphasis on the practice of neoliberalism as opposed to the economic ideology which obscures its class basis; neoliberalism as the third major capitalist restructuring of the 20th century as a response to the crisis of capitalism in the 1970s; the four economic policy areas, i.e., fiscal, monetary, industrial and external, that require restructuring as capitalism evolves into a new crisis; the fallacies of neoliberalism; government policy encourages offshoring of US manufacturing; global dollar recycling into US treasuries to support the twin US deficits solution; financialization of the economy; shadow banking; deregulation and privatization; neoliberalism socially destructive.</description>

      <description>In this first episode of season 2, Prof. Harvey talks about the massive economic problems the U.S. was faced with in the late 70s and 80s and how the crisis of 2008 was made clearer by that historical period.

      <description>In-depth analysis of UBI shows its advantages over most welfare, safety net systems. An even better alternative would avoid capitalism&amp;rsquo;s unnecessary production of unemployment because it utilizes technical progress (rising productivity) for profits. The alternative benefits workers&amp;rsquo; leisure rather than profits. It is more democratic and avoids splitting people into unemployed vs employed, non-poor vs poor. population.

      <title>David Harvey - The Rate and Mass of Growth</title>
      <link>https://beesgo.github.io/weblog/post/david-harvey-the-rate-and-mass-of-growth/</link>

      <guid>https://beesgo.github.io/weblog/post/david-harvey-the-rate-and-mass-of-growth/</guid>
      <description>In this lecture, David Harvey offers a close reading of Volume III of Karl Marx’s Capital to distinguish the rate of growth versus the mass of growth. Most economists, policy makers, politicians, and the financial press are very concerned about the rate of growth. The rate of growth is in turn critical to the formulation of policy. Yet the mass of growth is actually more significant, and deserves careful analysis. This lecture will devote special attention to the mass of growth.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Kevin Reed
2 November 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Famed rock music artist Roger Waters gave an extensive and significant interview to the television network Russia Today (RT) on October 25 in which he denounced the continued illegal imprisonment of Julian Assange and reiterated his call for the freedom of the WikiLeaks publisher and founder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julian Assange, who founded WikiLeaks in 2006 and published extensive proof of US war crimes in the Middle East and other corruption around the world, is currently being held at Belmarsh prison in London. Although he has broken no laws and not been convicted of any crime, Assange is being held in advance of being handed over—in blatant contravention of international law—to the United States to face 18 charges, including violation of the Espionage Act of 1917.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trade Unions &#39;Rich and Cowardly&#39; - FRFI! Newspaper</title>
      <link>https://beesgo.github.io/weblog/news/trade-unions-rich-and-cowardly/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 13:56:57 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://beesgo.github.io/weblog/news/trade-unions-rich-and-cowardly/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Created: Thursday, 31 October 2019 - Written by Robert Clough&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering his keynote speech to the 2019 TUC Congress in September, supposed left-wing trade union leader and TUC President Mark Serwotka plaintively asked of the future ‘Will we end up just observing the rise of the far right, including our current government? Will we watch, horrified, the further decimation of our public services? Will we look fearfully at the rise of racism and hate? Will we be passive witnesses of the growth of a climate emergency?’ All the evidence for the past ten years points to one answer – yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British trade union movement stood by as wages were slashed following the 2008 financial crisis, it has remained passive in the face of an onslaught on working conditions, and has pointedly protected Labour councils as they took an axe to jobs and services at the behest of the Tory austerity programme. When Serwotka concluded ‘How can we step up to face the scale of these challenges? For Congress, I hope you agree – stand up to them we must!’, it was no more than braggadocio. British trade unions are not fighting organisations of the working class, and nor are they intended to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Welfare state alive in scotland but waning elsewhere - UN poverty expert</title>
      <link>https://beesgo.github.io/weblog/news/welfare-state-alive-in-scotland-but-waning-elsewhere-un-poverty-expert/</link>

      <guid>https://beesgo.github.io/weblog/news/welfare-state-alive-in-scotland-but-waning-elsewhere-un-poverty-expert/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A UN poverty expert has said Scotland is on “a very different trajectory” to the rest of the UK when it comes to social security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philip Alston, UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said the “spirit” of the welfare state is “alive and humming” north of the border, but is “waning” elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international human rights law professor visited the UK last year to produce a report which found policies of austerity introduced in 2010 were continuing to have “tragic social consequences”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also claimed the Scottish government’s attempts to reduce the impact of social security changes – such as the two-child benefit cap – were not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at an event at the University of Edinburgh, he said: “Scotland is spending a lot of money on mitigation, mitigating measures that they see as the least humane policies that come from London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All of this indicates that Scotland is – at least for now – on a very different trajectory than England when it comes to the social protection of its population.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>UK - More than a million welfare benefit sanctions imposed against disabled people</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Dennis Moore
13 March 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New data reveals the relentless attack on disabled benefit claimants in the last decade. The study found that more than 900,000 Job Seeker’s Allowance (JSA) claimants, who reported a disability, have been financially sanctioned since May 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also sanctioned were 110,000 claimants of Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), a benefit paid to someone who is sick, and placed in the “work related activity group” (WRAG). A further 140,000 sanctions were applied, but later cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sanction is applied to someone’s benefit when a claimant is deemed not to have met part of the stated “conditionality” for claiming that benefit. This can include missing an appointment, or not applying for enough jobs in a given time scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
